I'll help you create a comprehensive plan for your LearnDash integration plugin. Let's start by setting up the initial documentation.

I'll create a detailed plan document that outlines the plugin's structure and functionality:

I'll help you get started with the development. Based on the plan, let's begin by setting up the basic plugin structure and implementing the admin dashboard.

First, let's create the necessary directory structure:

Ran terminal command
…\LILAC\31-5 > mkdir -p "app/public/wp-content/plugins/lilac-learning-manager/admin/views" "app/public/wp-content/plugins/lilac-learning-manager/includes" "app/public/wp-content/plugins/lilac-learning-manager/assets/{css,js,images}"

mkdir : No se encuentra ning�n par�metro de posici�n que acepte el argumento 
'app/public/wp-content/plugins/lilac-learning-manager/includes'.
En l�nea: 1 Car�cter: 1
+ mkdir -p "app/public/wp-content/plugins/lilac-learning-manager/admin/ ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [mkdir], ParameterBindingException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PositionalParameterNotFound,mkdir
 
Exit Code 1

Not auto-run
Let me create the directories one by one to ensure they're set up correctly:

Ran terminal command
…\LILAC\31-5 > mkdir "app\public\wp-content\plugins\lilac-learning-manager\admin\views"

mkdir : Ya existe un elemento con el nombre especificado: 
C:\Users\USUARIO\Documents\SITES\LILAC\31-5\app\public\wp-content\plugins\lilac-learning-manager\admin\views.

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryExist,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewItemCommand
 
Exit Code 1

Let's verify the existing files and structure to proceed effectively:
