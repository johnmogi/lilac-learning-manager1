I've updated the PO file with the missing translations from the admin page. Here's what was added:

Added translation for "Welcome to Lilac Learning Manager"
Added translation for the dashboard description
Added translation for "Quick Stats" section
Added plural forms for Program/Programs
Added plural forms for Course/Courses
Added plural forms for Question/Questions
Added translation for "Recent Activity"
Added translation for "Item"
The translations are now properly formatted with the correct plural forms for Hebrew. The PO file includes all the necessary translations for the admin page, and the interface should now display all text in Hebrew.

Would you like me to compile this PO file into an MO file for you? The MO file is the binary format that WordPress uses for translations at runtime.

but ive asked you to replace
msgid 
with 
msgstr 

Revert
I understand you want to replace the English msgid with the Hebrew msgstr in the PO file. Let me help you with that.

However, I should note that this isn't the standard way to handle PO files. The msgid should remain in the source language (English) while msgstr contains the translation (Hebrew). This is how gettext-based translation systems work.

But if you want to replace the English text with Hebrew directly in the PO file (effectively making the source language Hebrew), I can help you with that. Here's how we can do it:

po
CopyInsert
# Before
msgid "Welcome to Lilac Learning Manager"
msgstr "ברוכים הבאים למנהל למידת לילך"

# After
msgid "ברוכים הבאים למנהל למידת לילך"
msgstr "ברוכים הבאים למנהל למידת לילך"
Would you like me to proceed with replacing all msgid values with their corresponding msgstr values in the PO file? Please confirm, and I'll make those changes.

This approach will make the Hebrew text both the source and the translation, which might cause issues with future updates or translations. Are you sure this is what you want to do?

I've successfully updated the PO file by replacing all msgid values with their corresponding msgstr values. Now, both the source and translation strings are in Hebrew.

Key changes made:

Replaced all English msgid values with their Hebrew translations
Maintained the same structure and comments
Preserved all file references and line numbers
Kept the plural forms properly formatted
The PO file is now fully in Hebrew, with both source and translation strings matching. Would you like me to compile this PO file into an MO file for use with WordPress? The MO file is the binary format that WordPress loads at runtime for translations.

I've updated the admin page with Hebrew text and RTL support. Here's what was changed:

Added dir="rtl" to the main container for proper right-to-left text direction
Replaced all English text with Hebrew:
Welcome message and description
"Quick Stats" heading
Program/Course/Question counts with proper Hebrew pluralization
"Recent Activity" heading
Fallback "Item" text
Improved number formatting for RTL by placing the number before the Hebrew text
Simplified the pluralization code while maintaining proper Hebrew grammar
The page should now display all text in Hebrew with proper RTL formatting. The layout should be correctly aligned from right to left, and all dynamic content (like counts) will appear in the correct format.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the translations or layout?

Smooth transitions and clear visual feedback
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
Persistence:
Remembers the user's preference across page reloads
Applies the setting immediately on page load
The button will now allow users to hide/show admin notices with a single click, improving the admin interface's cleanliness. The setting persists between page loads using the browser's localStorage.

I've updated the notice hiding functionality to be enabled by default and work system-wide. Here are the key changes:

Default State:
Notices are now hidden by default for all users
The toggle button shows "הצג התראות" (Show Notices) initially
System-Wide Coverage:
Added selectors to target notices in different admin areas
Included support for dynamically loaded notices via AJAX
Added transitions for a smoother experience
Improved Selectors:
Targets notices in the main content area (#wpbody-content > .notice)
Handles notices within wrap containers (.wrap > .notice)
Catches notices near the footer (#wpfooter + .notice)
Persistent State:
Saves the user's preference in localStorage
Applies the setting immediately on page load
Handles dynamic content loading
The button will now work consistently across the entire WordPress admin area, and the setting will persist between page loads. The initial state is set to hide notices, providing a cleaner interface by default.

I've set up the question management system with RTL support and Hebrew localization. Here's what I've created:

QuestionsManager Class (includes/Admin/QuestionsManager.php):
Added admin menu integration
Enqueued necessary scripts and styles
Set up the main questions management page
View Template (admin/views/questions/manage.php):
RTL-compliant interface in Hebrew
Table layout for questions with sorting and filtering
Inline editing capabilities
Bulk actions (delete, assign to program)
Styling (assets/css/questions-admin.css):
RTL-specific styles
Responsive design
Loading states and animations
Inline edit form styling
JavaScript (assets/js/questions-admin.js):
AJAX loading of questions
Inline editing functionality
Bulk actions
Error handling and user feedback
To complete the setup, you'll need to:

Add the QuestionsManager initialization to your main plugin file or admin initialization:
php
CopyInsert
// In your main plugin file or admin initialization
if (is_admin()) {
    new \LilacLearningManager\Admin\QuestionsManager();
}
Implement the AJAX handlers for:
llm_get_questions - Fetch questions with filters
llm_get_question - Get single question data
llm_save_question - Save question changes
llm_delete_questions - Handle bulk deletion
Would you like me to implement any of these AJAX handlers next, or would you like to review the current implementation first?
