✅ GOAL: Custom LearnDash Question Manager (Lilac Questions)
We’ll build a dedicated admin panel that lets you:

Feature	Purpose
🔍 Search Questions	Quickly find by keyword or hint
🎯 Filter by Course/Program/Topic	Navigate large banks easily
📝 Inline Edit	Fix answers, hints, points in-place
📚 Show Related Course & Program	Clarify where question is used
💡 Manage Hint separately	Avoid LearnDash’s hidden meta fields
✅ Bulk Actions	Delete, assign, tag questions

🗂️ FILE STRUCTURE TO ADD
File/Folder	Purpose
admin/views/questions/list.php	Main custom UI for question list
includes/Admin/QuestionAdmin.php	Backend controller
assets/js/question-admin.js	AJAX / inline editing
assets/css/question-admin.css	Table UI styling
includes/Helpers/LearnDashQuestionHelper.php	Data fetchers (answers, hints, etc.)

🧠 DATABASE SOURCE (for Questions)
All LearnDash questions are stored in:

Post Type: sfwd-question

Metadata includes:

_sfwd-question (serialized array — ugly!)

question_pro (JSON for newer LD versions)

course_id, lesson_id, quiz_id

We’ll write helper functions to:

Extract: title, correct answer, hint, assigned course/quiz

Save: updated hint, points, correct answer via AJAX

🔘 Filters at top:

Search box

Program dropdown

Course dropdown

Topic (taxonomy) dropdown

🧩 Bonus: Use WP List Table or build with a Vue/React component for speed.

🔧 FIRST STEP: What I Will Create
Add Questions page under your Lilac LMS menu

list.php will:

Query sfwd-question

Show basic info: title, hint, course

Include filters (even if static at first)

Create QuestionAdmin.php to:

Handle AJAX updates

Provide filtered data

Create assets: question-admin.js, question-admin.css

✅ Ready to Scaffold This?
Let me know and I’ll:

Scaffold all required files (views, classes, assets)

Create the list UI

Add initial filtering & editing logic

Would you like to start with a read-only table, then add editing, or go straight into edit+filter version?
