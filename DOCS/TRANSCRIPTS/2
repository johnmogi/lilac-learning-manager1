You're right - I see you already have the ACF field enable_subscription_toggle in your configuration. I'll modify the code to use your existing field rather than creating a new one, and ensure we're properly bypassing the automatic course redirect.

Let's make these changes:

First, I'll update the admin class to use your existing ACF field:

Great! I've made all the necessary updates to ensure your existing ACF field enable_subscription_toggle is used and to properly bypass the automatic course redirect.

Here's what I've updated:

Removed duplicate ACF field creation - Now using your existing field enable_subscription_toggle
Added an Interceptor class that specifically prevents LearnDash's automatic redirection by:
Hooking into learndash_woocommerce_auto_complete_order to prevent automatic order completion
Hooking into learndash_woocommerce_auto_enroll to disable automatic enrollment
Hooking into learndash_woocommerce_get_course_id to prevent automatic course access
Modified product detection - Now checks each product in the order for the enable_subscription_toggle field value using the ACF function get_field()
This implementation will:

✅ Check your existing ACF field when an order is placed
✅ Block automatic course enrollment when that field is enabled
✅ Override LearnDash's built-in redirection to the course page
✅ Send the user to the thank you page as normal
✅ Show them a notice with a link to activate when they're ready
These changes ensure users won't be automatically redirected to the course after purchase if the product has the manual subscription toggle enabled. Instead, they'll stay on the thank you page and see a notification about activating their subscription.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or make any additional adjustments?

Let me fix this issue. The problem is that LearnDash's redirect happens before our interceptors can take effect. We need to use earlier hooks and a more aggressive approach.

I've completely overhauled the redirect prevention mechanism with a much more aggressive approach. The previous solution was too lenient and wasn't intercepting LearnDash's redirection early enough.

Here's what the new solution does:

Hook Priority: All hooks now use priority 1 instead of 10, ensuring our code runs before LearnDash's code
Complete Hook Removal: Added a new method that directly removes LearnDash's WooCommerce integration hooks that handle course redirects
Last-Resort Cancellation: Added a template_redirect handler that catches and cancels any redirect attempt that might slip through
Dynamic Hook Detection: Added code that intelligently finds and removes any LearnDash-related hooks regardless of their registration method
This approach takes control at multiple levels:

Prevents hook registration at initialization
Removes existing hooks during runtime
Cancels redirects if they're already being processed
This should completely solve the issue with being redirected to the course. Please give this a try with a new purchase - if you have the ACF field enable_subscription_toggle enabled on the product, you should now stay on the thank you page instead of being redirected to the course.

After examining the LearnDash WooCommerce integration code, I've found that the automatic course redirect is happening through a combination of hooks and mechanisms. While our current interceptor implements several strategies, we need to target the specific URL parameter that triggers the course redirect, which appears to be ld-wc-redirect.

Let's enhance our interceptor to more aggressively prevent the redirect by directly modifying the 
cancel_course_redirect
 method. Here's what I'll implement:

Target an earlier hook to catch the redirect before it happens
Remove any query parameters that might trigger the redirect
Add debugging information to help track what's happening

I've significantly enhanced the manual subscription interceptor to prevent course redirects in a more aggressive and comprehensive way. The previous implementation wasn't fully preventing the redirect because the LearnDash WooCommerce integration has multiple redirect mechanisms that were triggering even after our initial hooks.

Here's what I've improved:

Earlier Hook Interception: Now hooking into wp_loaded (the earliest possible hook) in addition to template_redirect to catch redirects before they can happen.
Comprehensive Hook Removal: Enhanced the hook removal system to catch all possible LearnDash redirect functions with more thorough detection of LearnDash-related callbacks.
Multi-layer Protection:
Direct blocking of the 
auto_complete_transaction
 method that triggers course completion
Advanced detection of course pages accessed immediately after checkout
Protection against the ld-wc-redirect parameter that triggers redirects
Template filtering to prevent LearnDash course templates from loading after checkout
Order Detection Improvements: Added fallback mechanisms to find the relevant order even when not on the thank you page or when the order ID isn't directly available.
Debug Tracking: Added a query parameter lilac-redirect-prevented=1 when a redirect is stopped so you can verify when the system is working.
These changes should effectively prevent any automatic course redirects for products with the manual activation toggle enabled. The user will remain on the WooCommerce thank you page and need to use your subscription activation form to gain access to the course.

Let's add some logging functionality to help debug the redirect issue. I'll create a logging mechanism in the interceptor class to track what's happening during the process.

Let's add debug logging to track what's happening with the redirects. This will help us identify exactly where the redirect is still slipping through.

I've added comprehensive debug logging to help us track down why the redirect is still happening. The logs will appear in two places:

In your WordPress error log (usually in wp-content/debug.log if debugging is enabled)
As HTML comments in the page source when you're logged in as admin
Here's how to check the logs:

To check the HTML comments:
When you're logged in as an admin, view the page source of the thank you page or any page where the redirect happens
Look for HTML comments that start with <!-- LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG
This will show the complete sequence of events that happened during the redirect attempt
To check the server logs:
Look in your server's error log or WordPress debug log for entries between these markers:

===== LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG START =====
[log entries here]
===== LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG END =====
When you attempt another purchase, the logs will show:

Which hooks were triggered
If the order was correctly marked for manual activation
If the redirect parameter was detected
What action the interceptor tried to take
Based on this information, we'll be able to see exactly where the redirect protection is failing and fix it. Can you try another purchase test and then share what you find in the logs?

i also deleted the following change:
 can see from the screenshot that you've reached the WooCommerce thank you page rather than being redirected to a LearnDash course page, which is a positive sign. However, let's check if our debug logs are being generated and what they might tell us.

The screenshot shows the thank you page in Hebrew with "תודה על רכישתך!" (Thank you for your purchase!) at the top, along with what appears to be a message that automatic transfers aren't happening, which indicates our code might be working.

To find detailed logs about what happened:

Check the HTML source code: Can you view the page source (right-click > View Page Source) and look for HTML comments that start with <!-- LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG? These would contain our debug information.
Check the WordPress debug logs: Look in wp-content/debug.log for entries between these markers:
===== LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG START =====
[log entries here]
===== LILAC SUBSCRIPTION INTERCEPTOR LOG END =====
Also, let's check if there's a URL parameter in the thank you page URL that might indicate our code prevented a redirect. Look for lilac-redirect-prevented=1 in the URL.

Since you've reached the thank you page rather than being redirected to a course, it suggests that either:

Our code is successfully preventing the redirect
Or there was no redirect attempt in this case
The logs should tell us which one it is. Without seeing the actual logs, I can't tell if the redirect was attempted and blocked or if no redirect was attempted for this purchase.

Would you like me to enhance the logging further to capture more details about what's happening during the purchase process?

I understand you're concerned about the redirection issue and want to be cautious with any changes. Since you've reverted the debug logging changes, let's try a different approach to diagnose the redirect problem.

Let's look at WordPress's existing debug logs to see if there's any information about the redirection:

Let's take a more targeted approach to fix the redirect issue. Based on our previous investigation, we know that the redirect is happening through the LearnDash WooCommerce integration, specifically through the 
auto_complete_transaction
 method and likely other hooks.

Rather than extensive logging, let's implement a simple but effective patch to target the exact redirect mechanism. Here's what I recommend:

I've implemented a more targeted approach to prevent the LearnDash redirect issue. This solution adds three layers of protection against unwanted course redirects:

Ultra Early Blocker: Intercepts at the wp hook, before most other WordPress code runs
Template Redirect: Continues using the existing blocker
Global Redirect Filter: Acts as a final safety net to catch any redirect attempts
The key improvement here is the addition of the wp_redirect filter, which is WordPress's core redirect function. By filtering all redirects globally, we can identify and block any redirect to a course page for orders that need manual activation. This should work regardless of how LearnDash is triggering the redirect.

The code is now focused specifically on:

Detecting redirects to courses (by checking URL patterns)
Checking if the associated order needs manual activation
Preventing the redirect if needed
This is a much more direct approach to solving the problem without extensive logging. Can you try another purchase test with this implementation? It should keep users on the thank you page without redirecting them to courses when manual activation is required.
