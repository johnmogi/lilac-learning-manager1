# Technical Requirements Overview

## \[User Role Management]

**Task:** Define and register roles used across the platform.

**Requirements:**

* Define three user roles with distinct capabilities: `school_teacher`, `student_school`, `student_private`
* Role assignment must match registration source and user type
* Ensure role-based access controls are enforced throughout the UI and backend

**Extended Description:**
Roles must support key permission separations. Teachers can manage content and students, school students get locked access (non-editable), and private students have a flexible self-service setup. Role assignment is critical during user creation from both WooCommerce checkout and promo code forms.

## \[Checkout Forms and Field Capture]

**Task:** Capture registration data during WooCommerce flows

**Requirements:**

* Implement custom fields: name, phone, ID, school code, program selection, delivery info (where relevant)
* Ensure all required fields are validated before purchase
* Ensure data is saved and associated with the WooCommerce order

**Extended Description:**
Forms vary by flow but reuse shared fields (name, phone, ID). Some flows include delivery details (Book Kit), while others require academic metadata. WooCommerce order metadata must persist for admin tracking, and promo/coupon codes must not conflict.

## \[User Creation Logic]

**Task:** Create WordPress users for eligible flows

**Requirements:**

* Users created only in flows 2, 3, and 4
* Phone number used as username
* National ID used as password
* Role assigned based on entry point
* Must support auto-login after registration

**Extended Description:**
Promo-based and paid access flows create `student_private` users. Duplicate users (same phone) must be prevented. After creation, user is automatically logged in and redirected. For security, passwords should be validated and hashed according to WP standards.

## \[Promo Code & Coupon Management]

**Task:** Enable access through promotional or discount codes

**Requirements:**

* Distinguish between WooCommerce coupons (discounts) and promo codes (access logic)
* Promo codes must be one-time use and bind to course/group/program
* Include validation states: valid, already used, not found, empty

**Extended Description:**
Promo codes are central to registration in flow 3, and optional in flows 2/4. They determine both user eligibility and access duration. Codes must be stored in a structure supporting lookup, status tracking, and user association.

---

## \[Course & Group Assignment]

**Task:** Assign users to LearnDash courses and groups based on flow

**Requirements:**

* Match Woo product or promo code to LearnDash course or group
* Ensure correct enrollment happens on successful registration or payment
* Avoid duplicate enrollments

**Extended Description:**
Users in Flow 2 join full courses; Flow 3 uses codes to define access; Flow 4 may limit access to practice groups. Assignment must update LearnDash’s internal progress tracking and permissions.

---

## \[Subscription Period & Expiry Handling]

**Task:** Track user subscription duration and handle expiration

**Requirements:**

* Each user must have an expiration date stored
* Automatically restrict access when expired
* Allow promo codes to extend or renew time-based access

**Extended Description:**
Most school users expire 30/6 by default. Others get calculated durations based on signup. Expiration must be respected system-wide, blocking course/group access past the date. Future logic can enable renewal via admin panel.

---

## \[Post-Login Dashboard Experience]

**Task:** Display subscription status, progress, and actions to user

**Requirements:**

* Show subscription end date, remaining days
* List completed topics, test results, and averages
* Allow entering promo codes (if permitted)
* Optional: Allow switching program (only for `student_private`)

**Extended Description:**
Dashboard is key to user engagement. All active learners should see their status, what’s left, and be reminded of deadlines. Teachers and school students may get different views. Switch-program action must confirm and wipe old progress if invoked.
