Here's the markdown plan `t2.md` with the **immediate next task** for your Lilac Learning Manager plugin development:

---

# 🟣 t2.md — Phase 3 Development Plan (Current Scope)

## ✅ Current Status Summary

* Plugin architecture: **Completed (Phase 1)**
* Core file structure & UI scaffolding: **Mostly Completed (Phase 2)**

  * Programs, Topics, and Schools admin sections implemented
  * Import/export for Programs and Topics available
  * Dashboard updated with real-time stats and Hebrew/English localization

---

## 🚧 Immediate Next Task

### 🔧 Scaffold “Manage Questions” Admin Page

A custom admin panel to **replace LearnDash’s default question editor**, focusing on:

#### UI Components:

* ✅ Table listing all `sfwd-question` posts
* ✅ Filters by:

  * Assigned Program (via custom taxonomy/meta)
  * Associated Course
  * Topics or Categories
* ✅ Show inline:

  * Question title
  * Question type
  * Correct answer(s)
  * Hint (custom ACF)
  * Media (custom fields)
* ✅ Bulk Actions:

  * Assign program/topic
  * Change question type
  * Import/Export via CSV
* ✅ Quick Edit or Inline Edit (Title, Answer, Hint)

---

## 🔄 Dependencies

* ACF fields for hint/media are **already implemented**
* Program/Topic taxonomies available
* Custom admin CSS/JS in place
* Basic admin list rendering logic used in `schools`, `topics`, etc.

---

## ✅ Immediate Implementation Steps

### 1. Backend

* [ ] Create `QuestionsManager.php` in `includes/Admin/`
* [ ] Hook into WordPress admin menu via `Admin.php`
* [ ] Query `sfwd-question` CPT with meta joins (program/topic, ACF fields)

### 2. UI Template

* [ ] Create `admin/views/questions/manage.php`
* [ ] Reuse existing table+filter+bulk action structures from `topics.php`

### 3. JS/UX

* [ ] Enhance `admin.js` to support inline editing
* [ ] Add AJAX endpoint for quick-edit saving

Would you like me to scaffold the initial PHP file structure (`QuestionsManager.php`, view file, admin hook), or implement filters first?
