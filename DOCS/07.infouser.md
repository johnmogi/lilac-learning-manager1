Since your current requirements revolve around active subscription status, expiration, source tracking, and per-user program data, WordPress usermeta is the right tool for the job. Here's a breakdown of why that choice fits well and what you should do next:

✅ Summary: Why Use usermeta
Feature	WordPress usermeta	Custom DB Table
Built-in API & tooling	✔️ get_user_meta() etc.	❌ Requires full CRUD setup
Plugin compatibility	✔️ Works out of the box	❌ Plugins won’t recognize
Caching/Performance	✔️ Object cache supported	❌ Needs custom optimization
Scale for per-user data	✔️ Efficient	❌ Overkill for simple needs
Migration/Audit/Reporting	❌ (limited)	✔️ (better for logging)

📦 What to Store in usermeta
Here’s a suggested meta structure (which you’ve already partly outlined):

php
Copiar
Editar
update_user_meta($user_id, 'llm_subscription_expiry', '2025-06-30 23:59:59');
update_user_meta($user_id, 'llm_subscription_status', 'active'); // 'active', 'expired'
update_user_meta($user_id, 'llm_subscription_program', 'school_theory'); // or 'private_car'
update_user_meta($user_id, 'llm_subscription_source', 'promo_code'); // or 'purchase', 'manual'
You can easily query and display this in dashboards, and WooCommerce hooks can update these values on purchase.

🔧 Suggested Next Steps (Usermeta-Based System)
1. Role & Capability Setup
Use add_role() and add_cap() to define:

school_teacher – manage students, view school reports

student_school – locked to school-assigned content

student_private – more flexibility, can switch programs

2. WooCommerce Hooks
Hook into woocommerce_order_status_completed to:

Assign role

Update usermeta

Grant access to LearnDash courses

3. Promo Code System
Create a custom post type llm_promo_code with:

Code string

Usage limit / expiration

Days to extend

applied_by tracking (user IDs)

4. Learner Dashboard
Shortcode or block that shows:

Current program

Expiry date

Progress stats from LearnDash

Promo code input form

🚫 When NOT to Use usermeta
Consider a custom table only if:

You need audit logs (history of all subscription changes)

You need reporting dashboards querying thousands of records

You want to track multiple subscriptions per user (e.g. per year/semester)

✅ So — Should You Proceed with usermeta?
Yes. For your current scope, usermeta is the most efficient and WordPress-native solution.

Would you like me to:

Generate the code for registering custom roles?

Write WooCommerce hook examples for assigning subscriptions?

Build a basic promo code validation flow?

Output a learner dashboard shortcode?

Let me know what you'd like next, and I’ll build it step-by-step with you.

can you carve out a complete task list fot the entire 4 users flows and 2 user types so i can pass it on to my developer
as in everything from the woocommerce standpoint to the learndash including missing tweaks if needed


ChatGPT Plus
Absolutely! Below is a comprehensive task list organized by user flow and user type, covering:

WooCommerce

LearnDash

Role & capability setup

Usemreta and promo logic

UX flows and edge cases

This should be ready to hand off to your developer as a structured brief.

🧑‍🏫 USER TYPES
1. Student - School Theory
Enters via school bulk registration (via Excel or promo code)

Cannot choose program

Subscription is fixed yearly until 30/06

Cannot renew manually

2. Student - Private (Self-Pay)
Buys access directly on the website

Chooses program: private_car or school_theory

Can renew manually

Can extend using promo code

🔁 FLOW A: School Registration via Excel Upload (Bulk by Admin)
Admin Tasks
 Create backend UI to import Excel with: first name, last name, school_code, phone, ID

 For each row, create user (if not exists)

 Assign role: student_school

 Set usermeta:

llm_subscription_status = active

llm_subscription_program = school_theory

llm_subscription_source = excel_upload

llm_subscription_expiry = 2025-06-30 23:59:59

 Enroll user in LearnDash course: “School Theory”

🔁 FLOW B: Student Enters Promo Code (from School)
Frontend Form (Before Login or Registration)
 Form fields: name, phone (username), ID (password), promo code, school code

 Validate promo code against custom post type (llm_promo_code)

 On success:

Create user (if not exists)

Assign role: student_school

Set usermeta as above

Enroll in LearnDash “School Theory”

 Error handling:

Used code? Show who used it

Expired code? Show message

Wrong format? Prompt retry

🔁 FLOW C: Student Purchases Private Course (Self-Pay)
WooCommerce Setup
 Product: “Private Theory Package”

Add attributes: program selection dropdown (private_car, school_theory)

 Checkout custom fields:

Program type (required)

ID number (required, used as password)

Phone number (required, username)

 On order completion (woocommerce_order_status_completed):

Create or update user

Assign role: student_private

Set usermeta:

llm_subscription_status = active

llm_subscription_program = [selected value]

llm_subscription_source = woocommerce

llm_subscription_expiry = +365 days

Enroll in LearnDash course based on program

 Email confirmation with login credentials (phone + ID)

🔁 FLOW D: Student Applies Promo Code to Extend Access
Inside Member Dashboard (while logged in)
 Promo code input field

 Validate:

Not expired

Not used

 On success:

Extend llm_subscription_expiry by code-defined days

Mark promo as used (associate with user ID)

 Update LearnDash access accordingly (if needed)

📚 LearnDash Setup
Course Structure
 Create two main courses:

“School Theory”

“Private Theory”

 Enforce strict program locking:

student_school only sees “School Theory”

student_private sees course based on selected program

Access Expiry Logic
 Use learndash_user_expire_access filter to expire based on llm_subscription_expiry

 Auto-expire course access and show message after 30/06 (school) or custom date (private)

🔐 Roles & Permissions
Define Roles
 student_school – limited dashboard, 1 program only

 student_private – can choose program, renew

 Optional: teacher_school – see class list & progress

Capabilities
 Students: read, access_course, custom flags

 Teachers (optional): view_school_students, export_progress

🧩 Promo Code System
Custom Post Type: llm_promo_code
 Fields:

Code (string, unique)

Type: school, public

Expires on (date)

Adds days: e.g. 90

Usage: 0/1 or multi-use flag

Assigned to user ID (once used)

Admin UI
 Add/Edit codes

 See usage logs

🧑‍💻 Backend & Dashboard
Learner Dashboard
 Show program

 Subscription expiry

 Promo code input

 Course progress (LearnDash blocks or custom)

Admin/Teacher Dashboard (if needed)
 Export student list by school

 View progress summaries

 Resend login info

 Reset subscription (manual override)

📤 Notifications
Automated Emails
 After registration (credentials)

 One week before expiry (school & private)

 After promo applied (new expiry date)

⛔ Edge Cases & Error Handling
 Prevent duplicate users (match by phone or ID)

 If user exists but no access → update rather than error

 Students can't switch programs

 Expired students can't log in (optional: show renewal link)

✅ Final Checklist for Developer
 WooCommerce custom fields + order hooks

 Role & capability registration

 Promo code logic (creation + validation + expiry)

 LearnDash enrollment + access expiry sync

 Frontend flows (promo code form, dashboard, login)

 Admin UI (upload Excel, manage codes, view users)

Would you like this exported as a clean Google Doc, Notion-style format, or handed off via email? I can generate that for you too.
