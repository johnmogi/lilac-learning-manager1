the purchase situation

we are using learndash + woocommerce

so by connecting a product to a course the user purchases and gets immediate access

all is good this is a good flow

however in 1 case we want to enable the user subscription by his choicce manualy

i first thought of adding a toggle box into the thank you order recieved but that woocommerce product course is redirecting the user to the course automaticly

can i hook into that? also from a ppc pov (not that we plan to) this is bad practivce there is no clear goal heare - im sure this is an issue

You can absolutely take control over that automatic enrollment and redirect, making the ‚Äúsubscription toggle‚Äù on the Thank You page workable for your flow. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Disable automatic course access (WooCommerce/LearnDash)
By default, LearnDash via WooCommerce enrolls users and marks the order Complete right after payment‚Äîgiving immediate course access and redirect. You can disable this with:

php
Copiar
Editar
add_filter('learndash_woocommerce_auto_complete_order', '__return_false');
This stops LearnDash from auto-completing the order, which delays enrollment and access until you manually confirm it

.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Hook into enrollment to make it conditional
LearnDash provides a hook that lets you decide whether a user should be enrolled automatically based on any condition‚Äîeven your toggle:

php
Copiar
Editar
add_filter('learndash_woocommerce_auto_enroll', function($should_enroll, $user_id, $product_id, $order) {
    // Example: check order meta flag set when user toggles subscription
    $subscribe = get_post_meta($order->get_id(), '_ld_manual_subscribe', true);
    return !empty($subscribe);
}, 10, 4);
Here‚Äôs the idea:

Remove the auto-complete to stop immediate access.

On the Thank You page, output a toggle checkbox (via woocommerce_thankyou hook) that sets order meta _ld_manual_subscribe.

Let the filter above check that flag and only enroll if true.

After paying, if they checked the box, manual enrollment happens; if not, nothing happens until you intervene.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Example: ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù checkbox on Thank You page
In your functions.php:

php
Copiar
Editar
// Insert toggle on Thank You page
add_action('woocommerce_thankyou', function($order_id) {
    echo '<form method="post">
        <label><input type="checkbox" name="ld_manual_subscribe" value="1" /> I want immediate course access</label>
        <button type="submit" name="ld_manual_subscribe_submit">Activate Subscription</button>
    </form>';
});

// Save the flag when form submitted
add_action('template_redirect', function() {
    if (!empty($_POST['ld_manual_subscribe_submit']) && is_wc_endpoint_url('order-received')) {
        $order_id = absint(get_query_var('order-received'));
        if ($order_id) {
            update_post_meta($order_id, '_ld_manual_subscribe', 1);
            // trigger enrollment immediately
            $order = wc_get_order($order_id);
            foreach ($order->get_items() as $item) {
                $product = wc_get_product($item->get_product_id());
                // enroll if product is a course
                ld_update_course_access($order->get_user_id(), $product->get_meta('_ld_course'), false);
            }
        }
    }
});
This gives users control‚Äîonly those who check the box get enrolled automatically.

You‚Äôve got a solid foundation‚Äîleveraging an ACF toggle on the thank-you page‚Äîand want to control the subscription flow *only when that checkbox is checked*, triggering activation later via user action. Here‚Äôs a refined implementation strategy for exactly that:

---

## üéØ Desired Flow ‚Äî Step by Step

1. **User purchases** the course via WooCommerce + LearnDash integration ‚Üí they‚Äôre enrolled automatically, with no immediate subscription activation.
2. **Upon login**, they may go to a dedicated page (like ‚ÄúActivate Subscription‚Äù) where they can manually toggle on access‚Äî*only then* do we trigger a timed enrollment.
3. This behavior only applies to that specific product/course scenario‚Äî*not* to others.

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Plan

### 1. Ensure automatic enrollment is active (default)

Since you *want* them to enroll immediately upon purchase, no need to disable default behaviors‚ÄîlearnDash\_woocommerce\_auto\_enroll stays as-is. So you get immediate course access.

---

### 2. Add ACF checkbox to the **Thank You** page meta-data

You‚Äôve already created an ACF checkbox field and populated it on the thank-you page. Now, let‚Äôs ensure that if it's checked, a custom meta key like `_needs_subscription_activation` is saved to the order.

```php
add_action('woocommerce_thankyou', function($order_id) {
    if (isset($_POST['acf']['field_subscription_toggle']) && $_POST['acf']['field_subscription_toggle']) {
        update_post_meta($order_id, '_needs_subscription_activation', '1');
    }
});
```

Ensure your ACF field‚Äôs HTML `name` attribute matches this ‚Äî adapt `field_subscription_toggle` to your actual field key.

---

### 3. Create a locked ‚ÄúActivate Subscription‚Äù page

Make a standalone page (e.g., slug: `/activate-subscription/`) restricted to logged-in users.

Inside its template (or via shortcode), add logic:

* Query for the user's **latest order**.
* Check for `_needs_subscription_activation = 1`.
* If found, display:

```html
<form method="post">
  <p>You opted in during the purchase. Do you want to activate your subscription now?</p>
  <button name="activate_sub" value="1">Activate Subscription</button>
</form>
```

---

### 4. Handle activation submission

```php
if (isset($_POST['activate_sub']) && $_POST['activate_sub']) {
    $order = wc_get_orders([
        'customer_id' => get_current_user_id(),
        'limit' => 1,
        'orderby' => 'date',
        'order' => 'DESC'
    ])[0] ?? false;

    if ($order && get_post_meta($order->get_id(), '_needs_subscription_activation', true)) {
        // For each item linked to LearnDash course:
        foreach ($order->get_items() as $item) {
            $prod = wc_get_product($item->get_product_id());
            $course_id = $prod->get_meta('_ld_course');
            if ($course_id) {
                ld_update_course_access(get_current_user_id(), $course_id, true);
            }
        }
        update_post_meta($order->get_id(), '_needs_subscription_activation', '0');
        echo "<p>Subscription activated! You now have access to course content for the defined period.</p>";
    }
}
```

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purchase                              | Learner is enrolled in the course, but subscription isn‚Äôt active yet                          |
| ACF toggle checked on Thank You       | Order gets `_needs_subscription_activation=1`                                                 |
| User visits `/activate-subscription/` | Sees an activation form (only if toggle checked)                                              |
| User clicks "Activate"                | We enroll with a timed access using `ld_update_course_access(..., true)`, then clear the flag |

---

### ‚úÖ Why this works for your case:

* ‚úÖ **Selective**: Only affects orders where the ACF toggle was checked.
* ‚úÖ **User-controlled**: Activation only occurs when they decide to, not forced on purchase.
* ‚úÖ **Keeps default enrollment intact** while extending access manually.
* ‚úÖ **Organized & scalable**: The `/activate-subscription/` page centralizes the workflow and UI.
* ‚úÖ **Extensible**: You can customize enrollment time limits, notices, or email follow-ups if needed.

I've created a well-structured OOP solution for the manual subscription activation feature. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:

1. Main Components
Manual_Subscription (main class)
Handles the core functionality and initialization
Creates the activation page if it doesn't exist
Coordinates between admin and frontend components
Manual_Subscription_Admin
Adds an ACF toggle field to WooCommerce products
Handles saving the subscription toggle status
Removes course access when manual activation is enabled
Manual_Subscription_Frontend
Renders the activation form via shortcode
Handles form submission and activation
Shows appropriate messages based on user status
2. Key Features
ACF Integration: Adds a toggle to products for enabling manual activation
Custom Activation Page: Automatically created at /activate-subscription/
Flexible Access Control: Users can activate their subscription at any time
Robust Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
Clean Code: Follows WordPress and OOP best practices
3. How It Works
Admin:
Adds a "Enable Manual Activation" toggle to WooCommerce products
When enabled, users won't get immediate course access
Checkout:
If the product has manual activation enabled, the order is marked accordingly
User receives a notice with a link to activate their subscription
Activation:
User visits the activation page
Clicks "Activate Subscription Now"
Course access is granted immediately
4. Files Created/Modified
New Files:
class-manual-subscription.php
 - Main class
class-manual-subscription-admin.php
c:\Users\USUARIO\Documents\SITES\LILAC\12-6\app\public\wp-content\plugins\lilac-learning-manager\includes\ThankYou\class-manual-subscription-admin.php
 - Admin functionality
class-manual-subscription-frontend.php
 - Frontend handling
Updated Files:
lilac-learning-manager.php
 - Added initialization code
5. Usage
Go to a WooCommerce product
Find the "Subscription Activation" meta box
Toggle "Enable Manual Activation"
Save the product
Now when customers purchase this product, they'll need to manually activate their subscription from the activation page.

Would you like me to add any additional features or make any adjustments to the implementation?
